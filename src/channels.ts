 * whichever path made it.
 * - A channel the resolver names (text, announcement, voice, stage): its
 *   address, `#name (Guild)`, the string a tool's channelId accepts back,
 *   while that resolves back to it (nameResolves).
 * - A thread: `#parent › thread (Guild)`, display only (formatThreadLabel
 *   says why), or `› thread (Guild)` when its channel's name isn't known.
 *   Threads are addressed by id.
 * - Anything else: its composite id, `discord:<guild>:<channel>`, which
 *   addresses exactly this channel. That is the label when the guild's or
 *   the channel's name isn't known (a bare `#name` would resolve to a
 *   same-named channel in whichever guild has one), for a kind the resolver
 *   doesn't name, for a voice or stage channel whose name has a thread
 *   label's shape (`general › design`), which the resolver refuses as a
 *   name, and for a channel whose name resolves to another channel: a voice
 *   channel beside a same-named text channel, which the resolver prefers,
 *   or two channels of one name and kind.
 * The server re-derives a registered label when what it's made from changes,
 * another channel's name included.

 *
 * type is required in MCPL, and every host we know sends it (agent-framework's
 * ChannelsOpenParams makes it a required field, so its exact thread opens
 * carry it too). So it must be a non-empty string, and the channel opened must
 * be of that type; a missing or invalid type is refused, never read as "any".
 *
 * channelId, when given, is the exact selector, and it alone selects: an
 * address beside it isn't read, whatever it says. MCPL's SPEC has no channelId
 * on channels/open; agent-framework's ChannelsOpenParams gives it as "Exact
 * registered id. Preferred over type/address matching.", and hosts code
 * against that. Absent or null means no channelId. An empty string
 * or a non-string is refused, since it names nothing.
 *
 * Without a channelId, an address naming a guildId and a channelId (both
 * non-empty strings) is the exact selector. An address that is absent, null or
 * {} names nothing, and anything else is refused.
 *
 * An exact selector that names a registered channel opens it. One that is
 * well-formed but not registered is handed back as `unregistered`, for the
 * server to look up in Discord: it may be a channel this server serves that
 * no traffic has registered yet (a DM after a restart, say). An exact
 * selector never falls back to another channel. With no selector at all, a
 * request opens the one channel of its type, every registered kind counted
 * (DMs among them), and is refused when there are none or several.
