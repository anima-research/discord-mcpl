 * - A thread: `#parent › thread (Guild)`, display only (formatThreadLabel

 *   Threads are addressed by id.
 * - Anything else: its composite id, `discord:<guild>:<channel>`, which
 *   addresses exactly this channel. That is the label when the guild's or
 *   the channel's name isn't known (a bare `#name` would resolve to a
 *   same-named channel in whichever guild has one), for a kind the resolver
 *   doesn't name, for a voice or stage channel whose name has a thread
 *   label's shape (`general › design`), which the resolver refuses as a
 *   name, and for a channel whose name resolves to another channel: a voice
 *   channel beside a same-named text channel, which the resolver prefers,
 *   or two channels of one name and kind.
 * The server re-derives a registered label when what it's made from changes,
