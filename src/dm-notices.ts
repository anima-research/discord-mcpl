/**
 * Sender notices for DMs the DM allowlist refuses.
 *
 * A refused DM is never forwarded to the agent. Without a notice the sender
 * can't tell a contact filter from a resident ignoring them, so the connector
 * tells them once. This module holds the durable per-sender state that keeps
 * the notice to once per message, at most once a day per sender, and at most
 * DM_NOTICE_HOURLY_CEILING in any hour across all senders, through
 * restarts, reconnect catch-up and duplicate gateway events:
 *
 *   - floorId: a Discord snowflake. A message older than it never
 *     notifies, on any path: a gateway event can carry an older message as
 *     well as the catch-up sweep can. It moves to the moment notices are
 *     turned on, so nothing refused before then notifies later: while they
 *     are off nothing is recorded, and a new state starts off. It also
 *     follows the retention horizon below.
 *   - per sender, lastHandledId: the newest refused message already handled.
 *     A message whose id isn't newer never notifies again.
 *   - per sender, lastNotice: the last notice's message, when it was
 *     reserved, and its outcome. It's reserved (persisted, outcome
 *     "pending") BEFORE the send and settled to sent / failed / unknown
 *     after. A reservation found still pending when the state is opened
 *     was interrupted (say, by a crash after dispatch): it becomes unknown,
 *     is reported once, and is never retried.
 *
 * The hourly ceiling bounds what a wave of new accounts DMing the bot can
 * cause: each would get its one notice, an unbounded burst of outbound DMs,
 * which is the pattern Discord's anti-spam watches bot accounts for. It
 * counts the senders whose last notice was reserved within the hour. Each
 * sender has at most one notice a day, so that is every notice reserved
 * within the hour, durable with the rest of the state. Past the ceiling, a
 * refused DM gets no notice; it is still handled, so it never notifies
 * later.
 *
 * A sender is kept for DM_NOTICE_RETENTION_MS after their latest refusal
 * or notice, then dropped, and the floor follows that horizon, so a message
 * from before it can't notify once its sender is gone. The file holds the
 * senders refused within the retention while notices were on, not everyone
 * ever refused.
 *
 * The same file holds the resident's on/off setting for notices. It is off
 * until the resident turns it on with filters_update setDmNotice: a bot
 * account shouldn't start sending text to strangers because the connector was
 * upgraded, with nobody having chosen it. The choice survives restarts
 * whether or not a filters file is configured.
 *
 * The state lives in its own file, separate from the filters file. If it
 * can't be read or written, notices are suspended rather than sent without a
 * durable limit; refusals themselves are unaffected.
 *
 * The file is read and written asynchronously, so a slow disk never stalls
 * the gateway, and the state's operations (open, decide, recordOutcome,
 * setEnabled) run one at a time, in the order they were called: each sees the
 * state the one before it left. Every change rewrites the whole file. While
 * notices are off, a refusal changes nothing, so nothing is written.
