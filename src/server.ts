   *
   * - Every send here, the create and a resend without media, goes through
   *   sendWithRetries: an answer that leaves it worth sending again, by what
   *   the MCPL spec defines (answerClass), sends the same occurrence again.
   * - Accepted, or answered without a per-message verdict (an older host):
   *   `handleDiscordMessage:sent`, with `result`.
   * - Refused, by a result or by an error the host answered with
   *   (errorRejection): one `[discord-mcpl] host rejected message …` stderr
   *   line and `handleDiscordMessage:rejected` with the reason, an error's
   *   code, and what the message carried inline. channels/incoming answers
   *   each message without a code, so there the host's own failure reads the
   *   same as a refusal, and the line says `host didn't take message …`.
   * - Refused as malformed (isContentRejection) while carrying inline
   *   images/audio: resent ONCE, as a new occurrence, with each inline block
   *   replaced by a text note, so the text, and the fact that media was
   *   attached, still reach the agent. A compatibility measure for
   *   agent-framework's hosts before 0.22.2, which gave that answer to
   *   content over 1 MiB; see isContentRejection.
   * - No verdict after the resends sendWithRetries allows (no answer, a
   *   closed connection, the host's own failure): `[discord-mcpl] <lane>
   *   failed:` and `handleDiscordMessage:send-failed`.
