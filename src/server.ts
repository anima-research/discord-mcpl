 * Serve MCPL clients on a listening TCP server, one at a time, for as long as

 * `acceptTcp` takes a single connection, and leaves no listener that logs
 * the server's errors.
 *
 * - A client that connects while none is served is served: `serve` runs with
 *   its connection, and once `serve` settles, whether it resolves, rejects
 *   or throws, the connection is closed and the next client can be served.
 *   A rejection or a throw is logged. A client counts as served until then,
 *   after its socket has closed too.
 * - A client that connects while another is served is refused: its socket
 *   is destroyed at once, and the refusal logged. Its 'error' listener goes
 *   on first, so nothing that socket reports can go unheard.
 * - An 'error' the server emits (an accept that fails, say) is logged
 *   whenever it comes, and serving goes on: Node's server keeps listening.
 *
 * A read error on the served client's own socket (a reset, say) still ends
 * the process: it also reaches mcpl-core's readline interface, which listens
 * for none (see serve()).
 *
 * The server must be listening already, or this throws: a failure to listen
 * (a port already taken) belongs to the caller, and with the 'error'
 * listener added here it would only be logged, and the caller would wait for
