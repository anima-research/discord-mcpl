/**
 * Values in a `[source: …]` header, rendered so they can't become structure.
 *
 * The grammar is shared with the agent framework, which stamps the same
 * header on inbound messages (room-203 #41210):
 *   [source: <canonical-channel-id> · <label>]   (this server's standalone form)
 * Labels come from Discord: guild, channel and thread names and members'
 * display names, any of which may hold `]`, `·`, quotes or controls. A label
 * like `x] [source: discord:g:other · #admin` must not read as a second
 * attribution. So, as the framework does (agent-framework
 * src/mcpl/inbound-source.ts, `headerValue` / `labelValue`):
 * - a value with any character the grammar uses (brackets, the `·` and ` / `
 *   separators, quotes, backslashes), any control or line-separator
 *   character, or anything invisible is rendered as a quoted, escaped string
 *   literal. Invisible means a format or default-ignorable character
 *   (zero-width characters, bidi overrides and isolates, the Hangul fillers,
 *   variation selectors outside an emoji) or a space other than U+0020: such
 *   characters can hide a header word, reorder the line for a human reader,
 *   or make a lookalike ` / `. So a value with one is quoted for that alone,
 *   whatever follows it, and any other space around a slash is quoted as
 *   such. The escape spells each one out, so nothing acts from inside the
 *   quotes;
 * - a label beginning with one of the header's own words (`thread`,
 *   `reply to`, `unscoped`) is quoted too, since it stands where a tail
 *   would. One that an invisible character hides is quoted already;
 * - every other value is rendered as is. A header is always one line.
 *
 * A well-formed emoji sequence keeps its zero-width joiners and variation
 * selectors raw. Channel and display names carry emoji, and an escaped
 * `❤\ufe0f-cats` is a name the reader can't type back (agent-framework#269;
 * the same rule as the framework's).
 */

/**
 * Characters a reader can't see: every format character (`\p{Cf}`: zero-width
 * characters, bidi overrides and isolates) and every default-ignorable code
 * point, which adds fillers that are letters (U+3164, U+115F, U+1160, U+FFA0),
 * the combining grapheme joiner and the variation selectors. A visible
 * look-alike, such as U+2800 BRAILLE PATTERN BLANK, stays as it is. The
 * constants below are the framework's (inbound-source.ts), character for
 * character, so the two renderings keep one rule.
