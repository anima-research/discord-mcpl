/**
 * What Discord's answer means for the id a tool was given.
 *
 * An id Discord doesn't know comes back as two words, "Unknown Channel",
 * which says nothing about what went wrong or what to do instead. A name has
 * the resolver's own answers (channel-names.ts); an id has no candidates to
 * list, so the explanation names what the answer means for the id that was
 * passed and how to get a real one. Ids get misremembered: one recalled
 * rather than copied is the commonest way to reach this.
 *
 * The explanation is appended after the error's own text, so the error's
 * words stay as they were. Errors other than these five pass through
 * unchanged.
