/**
 * Discord event filters (guild/channel whitelist + DM user whitelist +
 * operator-maintained reaction suppression) with optional hot-reload from a
 * JSON file.
 *
 * Precedence: when DISCORD_FILTERS_FILE is set and the file exists, the file
 * wins over the DISCORD_GUILD_ID / DISCORD_DM_USERS env vars. When
 * DISCORD_FILTERS_FILE is set but the file does not exist yet, it is seeded
 * from the env values — so from then on, edits (by hand, by ops tooling, or
 * by the agent via the `filters_update` tool) are hot-applied within seconds,
 * no restart required.
 *
 * Semantics (unchanged from the env-only implementation):
 *   - guildIds unset/empty          -> ALL guilds allowed
 *   - guildChannels[gid] unset      -> all channels in that guild
 *   - dmUsers unset/empty           -> ALL DM users allowed
 *
 * File schema:
 *   {
 *     "guildIds": ["111", "222"],
 *     "guildChannels": { "222": ["333", "444"] },
 *     "dmUsers": ["555"],
 *     "suppressedReactionEmojis": ["<emoji>", "<custom emoji snowflake>"]
 *   }
 *
 * The plane has ONE desired/effective/status lifecycle (DiscordFiltersState
 * below), shared by the whitelists and the suppression key alike: guild/DM
 * state goes stale under exactly the same failures (unparseable rewrite,
 * deleted file) as suppression does, so staleness is a property of the
 * plane, not of any one key.

/**
 * One desired/effective/status state for the whole Discord filters plane,

 *
 * This class holds no file I/O of its own: the filters lifecycle (env seed
 * → DISCORD_FILTERS_FILE → 3s mtime poller → filters_update) drives it
 * through applyParsed()/markBroken(). Guild/DM whitelists and the
 * suppression key share one staleness model because they fail together —
 * an unparseable rewrite or deleted file makes ALL of them stale, and
 * reporting that per-plane (not per-key) is what keeps disk≠process from
 * hiding.
 *
 * Suppression sources, in precedence order:
 * - file key present (even empty): sole authority. An explicit `[]` means
 *   the operator chose no suppression — it beats every default. A
 *   concurrently-set legacy env is IGNORED — never unioned — with a
 *   glyph-free warning; a concurrently-injected baseline is overridden
 *   silently (that is normal operation, not an anomaly).
 * - file key absent, DISCORD_SUPPRESS_REACTION_EMOJIS set at startup: the
 *   deprecated compatibility source (process-static snapshot; changing the
 *   env requires a restart). Pre-existing filter files that lack the key
 *   stay on this source — no surprise rewrite of an operator's file.
 *   Operator-explicit, so it beats the baseline below.
 * - file key absent, DISCORD_SUPPRESSED_REACTIONS_BASELINE set at startup:
 *   the host-injected protective baseline (source 'baseline-default').
 *   The Agent Framework owns the refusal-category→reaction map because it
 *   places the annotations; host composition derives the concrete set and
 *   injects it below the model line — Discord never authors or duplicates
 *   that catalog, it only enforces what it is handed. Process-static, not
 *   deprecated: this is the intended default-protective path for
 *   host-launched deployments. Standalone Discord without a host injects
 *   nothing and honestly reports no protection.
 * - none of the above: honestly off.
 *
 * Baseline is for NEVER-CONFIGURED, not for lost configuration: a file
 * that goes missing or unparseable at runtime keeps the reviewed
 * stale-LKG / fail-closed postures and never silently degrades back to
 * the baseline — desired state that existed and was lost is a failure to
 * witness, not an invitation to re-default.
 *
 * Failure posture when the plane breaks (markBroken), decided by what the
 * last GOOD parse established:
 * - good parse exists, key had entries → suppression 'stale': keep
 *   enforcing the last-known-good set. Process-lifetime only.
 * - good parse exists, key was empty → 'unavailable': withhold ALL
 *   reactions. An empty set is deliberately not a fallback — it suppresses
 *   nothing, so keeping it would fail open on the expected deployment
 *   sequence (ship the key empty, then typo the first real entries).
 * - good parse exists, key absent → the file never carried suppression, so
 *   its brokenness says nothing about suppression intent: the env snapshot
 *   (or nothing) continues; the plane status carries the invalid/missing
 *   fact.
 * - no good parse ever (broken at startup) → 'unavailable': intent is
 *   unknowable and a configured plane must not fail open. Whitelists run
 *   on the env fallback meanwhile; this widens a whitelist typo's blast
 *   radius to reactions — accepted: the failure is loud, message delivery
 *   is unaffected, and history surfaces carry an explicit
 *   reactionsUnavailable marker instead of a false "none".
