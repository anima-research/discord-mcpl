/**
 * The per-guild channel whitelist (`guildChannels`) and threads. A thread
 * counts as its parent channel, so it is admitted whenever its channel is,
 * including when the channel is admitted only through a listed category, and
 * also when it's listed itself. Before, only one parent level was checked: a
 * thread's parent is its channel, so threads in a category-admitted channel
 * were dropped, and a category-admitted forum lost every post.
 *
 * A thread the client knows only partly (built from an event that carried
 * its type but not its channel, so its parentId is null) is fetched before
 * the filters decide, on creates, reactions, edits and deletes alike.
