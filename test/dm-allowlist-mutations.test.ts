/**
 * The DM allowlist holds for a DM's edits and deletes as it does for its
 * creates. A refused sender's message never reaches the agent, so neither
 * does its edit or its deletion. A delete is judged by the DM's other party:
 * its author unless the message is the bot's own, else the DM channel's
 * recipient, since an uncached delete names no author. discord.js caches
 * every DM it receives, so without this a refused DM's deletion carried its
 * sender's id and username to the host.
 *
 * The client's channel fetch here behaves as discord.js's does: unforced, it
 * returns the cached DM channel, which may have recorded only the bot; forced,
 * it asks Discord, which names the recipient.
 *
 * Run: node --import tsx --test test/dm-allowlist-mutations.test.ts
