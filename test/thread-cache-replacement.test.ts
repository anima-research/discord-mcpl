/**
 * An event in a thread the client knows only partly waits for the thread's
 * lookup. While that lookup is pending, discord.js can replace the thread's
 * cache entry: the guild is removed and joined again, which builds a new
 * thread object. Each lane, the create, the deletion and the reaction, then
 * names and filters its event by what the cache holds after the lookup, not
 * by the object it held before.
 *
 * Found in review by Daphne, whose probe this test is built from. It drives
 * discord.js's own actions and gateway handler, with the REST reply held.
 * The create and reaction lanes read `message.channel`, a getter that
 * resolves the cache each time; the deletion lane holds the channel across
 * its lookup and reads the cache again after it.
