# Changelog

Notable operator-facing changes. Started 2026-07-29; earlier history lives
in the git log and PR descriptions.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Reaction suppression on the filters plane** (issue #21):
  `suppressedReactionEmojis` in `DISCORD_FILTERS_FILE` names reaction
  markers that are filtered out of every model-visible surface — live
  reaction events (including their event ids), `fetch_history` /
  `fetch_around` results, and channel-open backscroll metadata — before any
  text or token is produced. Raw Discord state is untouched: projection, not
  deletion. The key is **operator-maintained**: `filters_update` has no
  parameter that can carry it (in either direction — configured markers
  never transit an agent turn), and resident guild/DM updates round-trip it
  unchanged. `filters_get` reports redacted state only: status
  (`not-configured` / `configured-empty` / `active` / `stale` /
  `unavailable`), entry count, full `sha256:` digest of the normalized set,
  source, and load time — never the entries. Matching is the emergency
  filter's semantics (VS-16/colon differences ignored; numeric snowflake
  entries also match custom emojis by id). Failure posture: a bad rewrite
  after a good load keeps enforcing the last-known-good set
  (process-lifetime only, reported `stale` with `desiredState: "invalid"`);
  a filters file that is configured but was never readable withholds ALL
  reactions (`unavailable`, history messages marked
  `reactionsUnavailable: true`) until repaired. A malformed filters file is
  never overwritten by the env seed.
  The `DISCORD_SUPPRESS_REACTION_EMOJIS` emergency containment (2026-08-03)
  is now a **deprecated compatibility source**: on first materialization of
  the filters file it seeds the key (its one-time migration into the
  plane); an existing filters file without the key keeps using the env
  exactly as shipped — no surprise rewrite; once a file carries the key the
  env is ignored outright — never merged — with a glyph-free warning.
  Migration: write the key (or let first materialization seed it), unset
  the env, verify `source: "file"`; the alias retires per issue #16 once
  fleet inventory shows migrated files.

### Changed

- **Text attachments now inline into context only up to
  `DISCORD_ATTACHMENT_INLINE_MAX_BYTES` (default 5120 bytes)** — previously
  live delivery inlined text attachments up to 256KiB. Over the cap, the
  agent gets a name+size+URL note instead. The bound is enforced on actual
  received bytes, not Discord's declared attachment size. `0` disables text
  auto-inlining; values clamp to the 262144-byte (256KiB) absolute ceiling;
  malformed or negative values log an error and fall back to the default.
  Raising the cap intentionally restores the prior always-inline behavior.
  Images are unaffected: they inline as native image blocks under their own
  ceilings. (issue #30, PR #12)
